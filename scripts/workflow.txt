Add infoworks data export file and shapefiles (Nodes.shp and Links.shp) to:
.data/<catchment>/raw

Run preprocessing to prepare clean network data:

   To create nodes_clean and edges_clean (note, this may need editing depending on the infoworks export format and how messy the InfoWorks model is!!):
   ./scripts/preprocessing/clean_from_infoworks.py

   Check if infoworks data makes sense, there was a bunch of missing information in the export for us - used InfoWorks simulations to fill missing information only:
   ./scripts/preprocessing/check_converted_infoworks.py

   The output of this is 'edges_clean.geojson' and 'nodes_clean.geojson', we provide an example in ./data/Cranbrook/processed

To create partitions (produces ./data/results/<date>/partitions.geojson) for :
./scripts/preprocessing/run_partitions.py

To aggregate partition categorisation into compartments for simulation:
./scripts/preprocessing/aggregate_cmd.py

Run simulations for all partition in ./data/results/<date>/partitions.geojson:
./scripts/orchestration/simulate_cmd.py

Run comparison for a single simulation:
./scripts/postprocessing/simple_eval.py
./scripts/postprocessing/system_eval.py

Calculate performance metrics for multiple simulations
./scripts/postprocessing/nse_cmd.py

Run comparison across algorithms/timesteps/number of compartments:
./scripts/postprocessing/preserved_comparison.py
