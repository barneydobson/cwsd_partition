A 'scrambled' example to run the model is provided in scripts/scrambled_example.py to run graph partition and CWSD simulations for a randomised version of the network used in the study.

This code is for research transparency purposes only. A more user friendly and flexible version of CityWat-SemiDistributed is currently under development at Imperial College London.
